# PythonSnake

This is a classic Snake game written in Python using the Pygame library.

## Getting Started

1. Install Pygame:

If you don't have Pygame installed, you can do so using pip:

Bash
*pip install pygame*
Use code with caution.

2. Add Audio Files:

The game includes placeholders for background music and sound effects. To enable these features:

Create a folder named music inside the project directory.
Place your desired audio files or the audio files uploaded in the repository (MP3 format recommended) in the music folder.
Ensure the audio filenames match the ones specified in the code (Beep Short.mp3 and game-over-arcade-6435.mp3).

### How to Play

3. Run the game:

Bash
*python snake.py*  # Replace "snake.py" with your actual script name if different
Use code with caution.

>> Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's movement.

>> The objective is to collect apples (green circles) that appear on the screen while avoiding hitting the walls or your own body.

>> Collecting an apple increases your score and adds to the snake's length.

>> The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself. You can then choose to restart the game by pressing Enter.

### Features
Classic Snake gameplay with smooth movement.

Score tracking and high score persistence.

Optional background music and sound effects (requires adding audio files).
